- fixed bug (via TDD) where toolbar title didn't persist on
  rotation

- custom matcher for CollapsingToolbarLayout
- fixed bug (via TDD) where toolbar title didn't persist on
  rotation

in the app.  This is step 5 in the project tracker, and is prep
for converting the project to MVVM and adding Room (step 6 and 7).

Changes also include:
- removing build tools version (no longer needed in API 27)
- updating Gradle libs
- custom matcher for CollapsingToolbarLayout
- fixed bug (via TDD) where toolbar title didn't persist on
  rotation
- minor improvements (@nonnull annotation, tools:text)

Android Sunflower: add tests

Code reviewers: this commit adds testing around the two Activities
in the app.  This is step 5 in the project tracker, and is prep
for converting the project to MVVM and adding Room (step 6 and 7).

Changes also include:
- removing build tools version (no longer needed in API 27)
- updating Gradle libs
- custom matcher for CollapsingToolbarLayout
- fixed bug (via TDD) where toolbar title didn't persist on
  rotation
- minor improvements (@nonnull annotation, tools:text)
