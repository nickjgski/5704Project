Fixes the issue that only single line was displayed with nested RecyclerViews

Fixes the issue that only single line was displayed with nested RecyclerViews
where the inner RecycerView's adapter is FlexboxLayoutManager with FlexWrap is
set to wrap.

This was caused because height 0 was passed from the parent RecyclerView
if the layout_height is specified as wrap_content, thus
FlexboxLayoutManager didn't calculate the entire items.

This PR fixes the height (or width if flexDirection == COLUMN) of nested

Before this PR, the height (or width if flexDirection == COLUMN) of the
RecyclerView was set to 0 where RecyclerView is wrapped with another

layout_height="wrap_content" and flexDirection="row".
In such a case, the height of the inner RecyclerView
(attached RecyclerView for this LayoutManager) is set to 0.

E.g. when the child's layout_width is set to match_parent, the width
of that child needs to be determined taking the total cross size used
so far into account. In that case, the width of the child needs to be
measured again. Note that we don't need to judge if the wrapping occurs
because it doesn't change the size along the main axis. | 2017-04-12 04:34:02 | 20d8f97314c73fa85ecce2f40e031b810966f88d

  - The child which the has the end (start) margin has the largest width in the
    same flex line (or only a single child exists)
  - The child has a positive layout_flexGrow (or layout_flexShrink) attribute set

If these conditions were met, the width of the FlexboxLayout didn't take the bottom
margin on the child into account.

Fixes the issue #62

This fixes the edge case where the child's width is WRAP_CONTENT and some
of the contents along the main axis would be truncated if parent's padding
is added (if this is the case, remeasure the child with accumulated width
taken into account to avoid some of the contents to be truncated).
Because accumulated width is not taken into account in the first
measurement of each child (because FlexboxLayout has the concept of wrapping,
at the first measurement of each child, we want the child to be big as it
wants even if there is not enough left over space)

Fixes the issue #62 | 2016-06-06 07:40:07 | b143adfe8e1605f6f74874d2b398ccb2efb03055

Fixes the issue #62

This fixes the edge case where the child's width is WRAP_CONTENT and some
of the contents along the main axis would be truncated if parent's padding
is added (if this is the case, remeasure the child with accumulated width
taken into account to avoid some of the contents to be truncated).
Because accumulated width is not taken into account in the first
measurement of each child (because FlexboxLayout has the concept of wrapping,
at the first measurement of each child, we want the child to be big as it
wants even if there is not enough left over space)

Fixes the issue that only single line was displayed with nested RecyclerViews

Fixes the issue that only single line was displayed with nested RecyclerViews
where the inner RecycerView's adapter is FlexboxLayoutManager with FlexWrap is
set to wrap.

This was caused because height 0 was passed from the parent RecyclerView
if the layout_height is specified as wrap_content, thus
FlexboxLayoutManager didn't calculate the entire items.

This PR fixes the height (or width if flexDirection == COLUMN) of nested
RecyclerViews.
Before this PR, the height (or width if flexDirection == COLUMN) of the
RecyclerView was set to 0 where RecyclerView is wrapped with another
scrollable container (another RecyclerView or ScrollView) on the condition
layout_height="wrap_content" and flexDirection="row".
In such a case, the height of the inner RecyclerView
(attached RecyclerView for this LayoutManager) is set to 0.

Discard the calculated flex lines when configration changes are handled manually. (#201)

When configration changes are handled manually, onSaveInstanceState

were not discarded.

measurement. If the width (or height depending of the flex direction) is
different from the previous value discard the prior flex lines.

Fix the case child needs to be measured twice in the initial calculation (measureHorizontal/measureVertical) (#252)

This PR fixes the corner case where where the cross size of the
child is affected by a flex line in which the child being processed is the
first item.
E.g. when the child's layout_width is set to match_parent, the width
of that child needs to be determined taking the total cross size used
so far into account. In that case, the width of the child needs to be
measured again. Note that we don't need to judge if the wrapping occurs
because it doesn't change the size along the main axis. | 2017-04-12 04:34:02 | 20d8f97314c73fa85ecce2f40e031b810966f88d

Fix the alignContent behavior. (#251)

* Fix the alignContent behavior.

Fix the alignContent behavior in the following conditions.
- alignContent is set to flex_end
- The size of the content is larger than the flex container
- flexWrap is set to wrap_reverse

When these conditions are met, the last of the flex item should be
aligned to the top of the flex container, but the first item was aligned
to the bottom of the container instead.

Also fixes other values for alignContent
(center, space_around, space_between) to be Flexbox specification
compliant.

Fix the issue that child margins do not expand flexbox container with wrap_content (#155)

This PR fixes the case where:
  - layout_width is set to wrap_content for the FlexboxLayout
  - End (or start) margin is set to a child
  - The child which the has the end (start) margin has the largest width in the
    same flex line (or only a single child exists)
  - The child has a positive layout_flexGrow (or layout_flexShrink) attribute set

If these conditions were met, the width of the FlexboxLayout didn't take the bottom
margin on the child into account.

Fixes the issue #62

This fixes the edge case where the child's width is WRAP_CONTENT and some
of the contents along the main axis would be truncated if parent's padding
is added (if this is the case, remeasure the child with accumulated width
taken into account to avoid some of the contents to be truncated).
Because accumulated width is not taken into account in the first
measurement of each child (because FlexboxLayout has the concept of wrapping,
at the first measurement of each child, we want the child to be big as it
wants even if there is not enough left over space)
